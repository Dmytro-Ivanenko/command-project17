              Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
              dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a
              sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as
              cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches.
              It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid
              nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition
              to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of
              water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent
              detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth,
              semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C
              or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.

              Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared
              either by brewing coffee normally (i.e. carafe, French press,
              etc.) and then serving it over ice or in cold milk, or by brewing
              the coffee cold. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be
              added before cooling, as they dissolve faster. Iced coffee can
              also be sweetened with pre-dissolved sugar in water. Pre-packaged
              iced coffee is available as a grocery item in several countries,
              though without ice. Iced coffee is also regularly available in
              most coffee shops. Iced coffee is generally brewed at a higher
              strength than normal coffee, given that it is diluted by the
              melting ice.

              A milkshake (sometimes simply called a shake) is a sweet beverage
              made by blending milk, ice cream, and flavorings or sweeteners
              such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, fruit syrup,
              or whole fruit into a thick, sweet, cold mixture. It may also be
              made using a base made from non-dairy products, including plant
              milks such as almond milk, coconut milk, or soy milk. Milkshakes
              originated in the United States around the turn of the 20th
              century, and grew in popularity following the introduction of
              electric blenders in the subsequent two decades. They became a
              common part of youth popular culture, as ice cream shops were a
              culturally acceptable meeting place for youth, and milkshakes
              became symbolic of the innocence of youth.
